# 🧩 Project Overview

This Proof of Concept (PoC) introduces a blockchain-integrated data validation platform for grounds maintenance, with an initial focus on waste tracking. It supports:

- ESG compliance  
- Client trust  
- Regulatory audit readiness  

The solution leverages Azure cloud services and an Ethereum-compatible blockchain to deliver:

- ✅ SHA-256 hashed, tamper-evident records  
- ✅ Daily Merkle tree sealing with blockchain anchoring  
- ✅ Scalable per-client access via Cosmos DB partitioning  
- ✅ Blazor dashboard for record visibility and validation  
- ✅ Regulation-level queries for audit/reporting (e.g., PAS 2060)

Every state change is hashed, stored, optionally archived in Blob, and cryptographically anchored for transparent, client/auditor-facing verification.

# 🔧 Core Objectives

- Ensure data integrity via cryptographic sealing of records  
- Detect tampering and unauthorized changes  
- Enable client-specific and cross-regulation access  
- Establish a foundation for Proof-as-a-Service (PaaS)

# 🏗️ Solution Architecture

### 1. Blockchain Node (Docker/Besu)

- Private Ethereum-compatible chain  
- Anchors Merkle roots daily  
- Genesis-configured for client node extensibility  

### 2. Azure Function Apps

- **Writer**: Subscribes to events, retrieves full record, hashes and stores in Cosmos + Blob  
- **Validator**: Builds Merkle tree from sealed records, stores root on chain  

### 3. Cosmos DB

- Hash/metadata store  
- Partitioned by `client|date`  
- Indexed by regulation, recordType, sealed  

### 4. Azure Blob Storage

- Stores JSON record snapshots and certifications  
- Fingerprinted and optionally archived  

### 5. Blazor Dashboard

- Secure, role-based access  
- Record viewer with proof validation  
- Client and auditor views

# 🔒 Tamper-Proofing Mechanism

- SHA-256 hash on record write  
- Daily (or hourly) Merkle root sealing  
- Blockchain anchoring for audit integrity  

Stored in Cosmos:

- `hash`  
- `sealed`  
- `merkleRoot`  
- `proof[]`
