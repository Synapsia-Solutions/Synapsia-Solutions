🧩 Project Overview

This Proof of Concept (PoC) introduces a blockchain-integrated data validation platform for grounds maintenance, with an initial focus on waste tracking. It supports:

ESG compliance

Client trust

Regulatory audit readiness

The solution leverages Azure cloud services and an Ethereum-compatible blockchain to deliver:

✅ SHA-256 hashed, tamper-evident records

✅ Daily Merkle tree sealing with blockchain anchoring

✅ Scalable per-client access via Cosmos DB partitioning

✅ Blazor dashboard for record visibility and validation

✅ Regulation-level queries for audit/reporting (e.g., PAS 2060)

Every state change is hashed, stored, optionally archived in Blob, and cryptographically anchored for transparent, client/auditor-facing verification.

🔧 Core Objectives

Ensure data integrity via cryptographic sealing of records

Detect tampering and unauthorized changes

Enable client-specific and cross-regulation access

Establish a foundation for Proof-as-a-Service (PaaS)

🏗️ Solution Architecture

1. Blockchain Node (Docker/Besu)

Private Ethereum-compatible chain

Anchors Merkle roots daily

Genesis-configured for client node extensibility

2. Azure Function Apps

Writer: Subscribes to events, retrieves full record, hashes and stores in Cosmos + Blob

Validator: Builds Merkle tree from sealed records, stores root on chain

3. Cosmos DB

Hash/metadata store

Partitioned by client|date

Indexed by regulation, recordType, sealed

4. Azure Blob Storage

Stores JSON record snapshots and certifications

Fingerprinted and optionally archived

5. Blazor Dashboard

Secure, role-based access

Record viewer with proof validation

Client and auditor views

🔒 Tamper-Proofing Mechanism

SHA-256 hash on record write

Daily (or hourly) Merkle root sealing

Blockchain anchoring for audit integrity

Cosmos stores:

hash

sealed

merkleRoot

proof[]

🧪 Proof Exposure via API

GET endpoint returns:

X-Leaf-Hash

X-Merkle-Root

X-Sealed

X-Merkle-Proof-URL (optional)

Records can be independently validated

🗂️ Partitioning Strategy

Partition Key: client|date

Enables batching + fast access

Cosmos queries use regulation/date filters

👥 Roles & Access Control

Role

Access Scope

Client

Partition-based (only their records)

Auditor

Cross-client by regulation and sealed

Internal

Full access, admin, manual override
